# How to run
In src/, run the python script main.py and provide the **absolute path** of the input file.
'''
python main.py <absolute path to input file>
'''
There is no need to compile the python code.
The output file has the same name as the input file with postfix '.out' as well as the same directory.

Situations that the program cannot handle:
- On systems without python
- The input path is a relative path
